# üåæ **FNN Crop production rate prediction for farmers using Knowledge Graph**

# üìú **Project Overview**
This project implements a deep learning-based approach to classify crop production levels (low, medium, high) and visualize insights using a knowledge graph. A user-friendly Flask web interface is designed for user interaction, allowing real-time visualization of crop-specific knowledge graphs based on the input crop name.

# Features
Multi-class classification of crop production using a feed-forward neural network.
Knowledge graph visualization for relationships between crops, seasons, and states.
Flask-based user interface for seamless interaction.
Insights on top-performing states and seasons for a given crop.
Scalable design to incorporate additional data and real-time predictions.

# üìä **Dataset**
Source: Indian Agriculture Crop Production database.
Key Features:
`Crop Type`, `Season`, `State`, `District`, `Area`, `Crop Year`, `Production Rate`.
Target Variable: Production Class (`Low, Medium, High`).

# ‚öôÔ∏è**System Workflow**
1) Data Preprocessing:
        Handle missing values and normalize categorical data using label encoding.
        Define production classes using quantiles for multi-class classification.
        Scale feature data and one-hot encode the target variable.

2) Model Development:
        Train a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras with multiple hidden layers and ReLU activation.
        Use early stopping to optimize training and prevent overfitting.

3) Knowledge Base Construction:
        A KB for predicting crop production rates and prices can consist of the following components:

        Entities: Key objects such as crops, years, regions, production rates, and prices.

        Attributes: Characteristics of each entity (e.g., production rate, price, soil type).

        Relationships: Links between entities (e.g., "Region X affects Crop Y's production").

        Rules: Logical inferences or trends derived from historical data and predictive models.

4) Knowledge Graph Generation:
        Use NetworkX to create graphs visualizing crop relationships with states and seasons.
        Highlight the state and season with the highest production for the given crop.

5) User Interaction:
        Develop a Flask-based web application for user input and graph visualization.
